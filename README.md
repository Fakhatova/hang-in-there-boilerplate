-   When the  **View Saved Posters**  button is clicked, the saved posters area is shown and the main poster is hidden.

-   When the  **Nevermind, take me back!** or  **Back to Main** buttons are clicked, only the main poster section is shown.

-   On the new poster form view, users can fill out the three input fields and  click the  **Save This Poster** button. The submitted data is saved so that future random posters can use the user-created data.
